G2S (GPS-to-Scale) Loss is a dynamically-weighted loss that can be added to the appearance-based losses to train any monocular self-supervised depth estimation architecture to get scale-consistant and scale-aware depth estimates at inference. 

Here, we provide helper GPS dataloader and the G2S loss classes for using this loss with any model.


For details, please see the [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.02451) and [Presentation](https://youtu.be/tIuoqDUcZqs).


## KITTI GPS

The GPS files containing geodesic gps information of raw kitti dataset in local coordinates for training with the g2s loss can be found in the `assets` folder as `kitti_gps_raw.zip`.  
Unzip the file at `/path/to/KITTI/raw_data/sync` to merge the GPS files in the expected directory tree structure.

## Usage

You can use the `G2S` class in `lossG2S.py` within your project for scale-consistent and -aware predictions. 
This requires using the copresent GPS modality along with images.
To load the GPS, please adopt the `GPSDataloader` class within `dataloaderGPS.py` into your images dataloader.
